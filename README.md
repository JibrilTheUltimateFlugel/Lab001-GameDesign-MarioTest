Lab 001 Game Design - Mario Test

The very first lab of the Game Design and Development course
I implemented a very simple Reset system for the checkoff involving a Game Over Screen as a different Scene from the main Sample Scene with a Restart button that allows players to replay and restart the game
Builds is zipped into Builds.zip since the UnityPlayer.dll is too large of a file, it houses the .exe version of the Game Lab
